# Collatz-Conjecture-3D-Visualization 

This is a visualization of the Collatz Conjecture in 3D using a mouse-driven camera for Processing (PeasyCam)

the algorithm is fairly simple following the rules below:

There are 5000 branches in the visualization and the colors get more red for even numbers and more blue for odd numbers and use the sliders for even turns (`PI/14`, `PI/3`) and odd turns (`-PI/14`, `PI/3`). Three numbers are being compared in the sequence and then being rotated around an axis based if odd or not. The numbers are ordered such that the first is rotated around the X-axis, the second rotated around Y-axis, and the third is rotated around the Z-axis.
